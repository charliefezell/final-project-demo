Kids Can Code Demo
'''
Curious, Creative, Tenacious(requires hopefulness)

**********Gameplay ideas:
Have the theme (sprites) of the level change as the height of the player increases
Add new gameplay elements as height increases - "death" platforms? Different enemies? Low gravity?
Change many of the sprites

**********Bugs
Hitbox area of 'new' platforms is the same as the hitbox of the larger platforms
Jump powerups spawning on every single platform

**********Gameplay fixes
Worked on a more efficient way to change the platform sprite as the score of the player reaches a certain value,
but the hitbox bug is still an issue.

**********Features
Changing platforms as score increases
different background and player sprites

********Currently Working On....
Fixing platform bug, fixing powerups bugs,
Working on adding more types of platforms (need to fix platform bug before this can be done)

*******Additional Info
I continued to work on the 'rock' platforms' hit area bug but as you remember from when we worked on it in class, it was a very
confusing and difficult issue. Also, I worked more on the issue where 'boost' powerups would spawn on every platform but I was
unable to figure it out after searching stackoverflow and the kids can code website. I realize that there are not many significant
gameplay changes in my code, and this is due to much of my work time being consumed by trying to fix the issues that I stated above.
Thank you for the your help on this and for the great year!
